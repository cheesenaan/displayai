## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
The ResumeAI web application aims to help users create professional resumes quickly and efficiently.

### Scope
This document outlines the design and architecture of the ResumeAI web app, focusing on Django-based development with an SQL backend hosted on PythonAnywhere.

### Target Audience
- Development Team
- Project Stakeholders

## 2. Application Overview

### Description
The ResumeAI web app allows users to create resumes by inputting their personal and professional information. The app utilizes GCP for document generation, Django for the web framework, and SQL for data storage.

### Features
- User Registration and Authentication
- Resume Generation
- Google Cloud Platform Integration
- SQL Database for Data Storage

### Technologies Used
- Django
- SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- Google Cloud Platform
- PythonAnywhere for Hosting

## 3. Architecture

### Django Framework
The application is built using the Django web framework, which follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

### SQL Database
Data is stored in an SQL database, such as PostgreSQL, for structured data management.

### Hosting on PythonAnywhere
The application is hosted on PythonAnywhere, a cloud-based Python web hosting platform.

## 4. Components and Modules

### User Authentication
- Handles user registration and login.
- Manages user profiles and credentials.

### Resume Generator
- Generates resumes using GCP integration.
- Customizes and formats resumes.

### GCP Integration
- Integrates with Google Cloud Platform for document generation.

### Database Models
- Defines data models for user profiles and resume data.

## 5. User Interface

### User Dashboard
- Displays user-specific information and actions.
- Provides access to resume generation.

### Resume Input Form
- Allows users to input personal and professional data.
- Validates user input.

### Resume Preview
- Shows a preview of the generated resume.
- Offers options for download or sharing.

## 6. Data Flow

### User Registration and Authentication
1. User registers or logs in.
2. User authentication and authorization are managed.
   
### Resume Generation Process
1. User inputs data into the resume form.
2. Data is sent to the Resume Generator module.
3. Resume is generated using GCP.
4. Generated resume is stored and made accessible to the user.
   
### Data Storage and Retrieval
1. User data is stored in the SQL database.
2. Resume data is retrieved for preview and download.

## 7. Database Schema

### User Profile Table
- Fields: username, email, password, profile picture, etc.

### Resume Data Table
- Fields: user_id (foreign key), resume_content, date_created, etc.

## 8. Security

### Authentication and Authorization
- User authentication is handled securely.
- User roles and permissions are implemented for data protection.

### Data Encryption
- Data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted (HTTPS).

### Secure Communication
- Secure channels are used for communication with GCP.

## 9. Deployment

### PythonAnywhere Configuration
- Application and database are configured on PythonAnywhere.

### Database Setup
- SQL database is configured and populated with initial data.

### Application Deployment
- The application is deployed to PythonAnywhere.

## 10. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Unit Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests are conducted during development.

### User Acceptance Testing
- Users and stakeholders participate in acceptance testing.

## 11. Maintenance and Updates

### Bug Fixes
- Address and resolve reported issues and bugs.

### Feature Enhancements
- Continuously improve existing features based on user feedback.

### Security Updates
- Keep the application and dependencies up to date for security.
